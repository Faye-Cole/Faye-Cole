<h1 style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;Who Am I?<strong></strong></h1>
<p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Faye Cole, a 22-year-old enthusiast diving headfirst into the world of coding. While I'm relatively new to the scene, I'm fueled by an insatiable curiosity and a relentless drive to learn. Currently, I'm immersing myself in the realms of Java, C++, and HTML, but I'm always on the lookout for new languages and technologies to explore.</p>
<p>Beyond coding, my interests are as diverse as they come. I find solace in the strokes of a pencil as I sketch, lose myself in the pages of a good book, and escape reality through the art of animation. Writing is another passion of mine; whether it's crafting stories or jotting down thoughts, words have always been my trusted companions.</p>
